Sometimes being "ambitious" gets you in trouble.  When it does, `Smoke-and-mirrors` is here
to put out your `Ember` fire.

`Smoke-and-mirrors` is an `ember-cli-addon` that exposes performance minded `components` and primitives 
to help you deliver your ambitions without sacrifice or compromise.

## WIP (pre 1.0.0)

This addon is beta software, but development and testing is ramping up as 1.0 nears.
Features and APIs will lock with the release of 0.4 and only bug fixes will be performed
until the 1.0 cycle completes.
